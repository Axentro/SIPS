## Abstract

A SushiChain Improvement Proposal (SIP) is a design document providing information to the SushiChain community, or describing a new feature for SushiChain or its processes or environment. The SIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend SIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into SushiChain. The SIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the SIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

## SIP Work Flow

The SIP process begins with a new idea for SushiChain. Each potential SIP must have a champion. Someone who writes the SIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The SIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is SIP-able.

Small enhancements or patches to a particular piece of software often don't require standardisation between multiple projects; these don't need a SIP and should be injected into the relevant project-specific development workflow with a patch submission to the applicable issue tracker. The first step should be to search past discussions to see if an idea has been considered before, and if so, what issues arose in its progression. After investigating past work, the best way to proceed is by raising an issue in the [SIPS issue tracker][sips-issue-tracker] on Github.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a SIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Asking the SushiChain community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where SushiChain is used.

Once the champion has asked the SushiChain community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft SIP should be linked to the original issue on Github. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft SIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal. Following a discussion, the proposal should be submitted to the [SIPs git repository][sips-repo] as a pull request. This draft must be written in SIP style as described below, and named with an alias such as "sip-johndoe-infinite" until the editor has assigned it a SIP number (authors MUST NOT self-assign SIP numbers).

SIP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on both the initial idea and the SIP before submitting it for review.

It is highly recommended that a single SIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the SIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your SIP into several well-focused ones.

When the SIP draft is complete, the SIP editor will assign the SIP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, and merge the pull request to the SIPs git repository. The SIP editor will not unreasonably reject a SIP. Reasons for rejecting SIPs include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the SushiChain philosophy. For a SIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

The SIP author may update the draft as necessary in the git repository. Updates to drafts should also be submitted by the author as pull requests. In particular, unless there is a specific dependency on another SIP, SIPs should be written without assuming the success of any other outstanding SIP. Therefore updates to certain SIPs may be required in the event that another SIP progresses to Final or Active status.

## Transferring SIP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred SIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the SIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the SIP. We try to build consensus around a SIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing SIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a SIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the SIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the SIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

## SIP Editors

The current SIP editor is the SushiChain Foundation, who can be contacted at [info@sushichain.io][sips-email].

## SIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

For each new SIP submitted as a "pull request" to the [SIPs git repository][sips-repo] an editor does the following:

* Reads the SIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* Edits the SIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), as well as markup and code style.
* Checks the SIP title accurately describes the content.
* Checks the SIP draft has been attached to a Github issue for discussion on the [SIPS issue tracker][sips-issue-tracker].
* Checks the motivation and backward compatibility (when applicable) has been addressed.
* Checks the licensing terms are acceptable for a SIP.

If the SIP isn't ready, the editor will request changes from the author with specific instructions.

If the SIP is ready, the editor will:

* Assign a SIP number in the pull request.

* Merge the pull request when it is ready.

* List the SIP in the [README][readme].

The SIP editors are intended to fulfil administrative and editorial responsibilities. The SIP editors monitor SIP changes, and update SIP headers as appropriate.

## SIP Format and Structure

SIPs should be written in [Markdown][markdown] format. A template SIP is provided [here][sips-template] as the basis for all new proposals. As necessary, code examples may be used. These should be written in Crystal or simple pseudocode depending on the needs of the particular situation.

Each SIP should have the following parts:

* Preamble—Headers containing metadata about the SIP.

* Abstract—A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

* Copyright—Each SIP must be licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal][cc0].

* Specification—The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current SushiChain platforms. In the special case where the choice of a library is critical (e.g. security), a recommendation about libraries and reasoning should be included.

* Motivation—The motivation is critical for SIPs that want to change the SushiChain protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the SIP solves.

* Rationale—The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternative designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Backwards compatibility—All SIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

* Reference implementation—The reference implementation must be completed before any SIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. As long as the reference implementation is not finished, the reference implementation section can simply state “TBD”. Once the reference implementation has been completed, the corresponding pull request, issue or a milestone should be linked from the reference implementation section.

## SIP Header Preamble

Each SIP must begin with an [RFC 822][rfc-822] style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "?" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

```
  SIP: <SIP number>
  Title: <SIP title>
  Author: <List of authors' real names including email address>
? Discussions-To: <Link to discussion in SIP issue tracker>
? Comments-Summary: <Summary tone>
  Comments-URI: <Link(s) to wiki page for comments>
? Status: <Draft | Active | Proposed | Deferred | Rejected | Withdrawn | Final | Replaced>
  Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
  Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
? Requires: SIP number(s)>
? Replaces: <SIP number>
? Superseded-By: <SIP number>
```

### SIP

The SIP header contains the unique identifier of the SIP. Assigned by the SIP editor.

### Title

The Title header gives a brief and precise description of the proposal. An example of a good title is “Change to byte based block size limit”. Generic titles such as “Improve P2P Layer” should be avoided as there could be multiple improvements of this aspect of the protocol in the future and it is unclear which specific aspect of the protocol the proposal suggests changing. Note that once a pull request is opened on GitHub, the SIP editor will also confirm that the title of a SIP satisfies these guidelines and adjust it their discretion.

### Author

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the SIP. The format of the Author header value must be `Random J. User <address@dom.ain>`

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC 2822][rfc-2822] continuation line conventions.

### Discussions-To

The Discussions-To header contains a link to the discussion of the SIP on [SIPS issue tracker][sips-issue-tracker].

### Comments-Summary

The Comments-Summary header gives a summary tone of the comments the SIP has received from the community. (See the Specification section for SIP Comments below for possible summary tones.)

### Comments-URI

The Comments-URI contains one or more links to a wiki page where comments on the SIP have been made.

### Status

The Status header indicates the current state of the SIP. Assigned by the SIP editor.

### Type

The Type header specifies the type of SIP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

### Created/Updated

The Created header records the date that the SIP was assigned a number, while the Updated header is used to record the date of the last modification. Both headers should be in YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

### Requires

SIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the SIP numbers that this SIP depends on.

### Replaces

SIPs may have a Replaces header, indicating the SIP number that this SIP renders obsolete.

### Superseded-By

SIPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a SIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the SIP that replaces the current document. The newer SIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the SIP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files

SIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Image files should be included in a subdirectory for that SIP. Auxiliary files must be named SIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where "XXXX" is the SIP champion's name, or the SIP's number (once it has been assigned), "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").

## SIP Types

There are three kinds of SIP:

* A Standards Track SIP describes any change that affects most or all SushiChain implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using SushiChain. Standards Track SIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation.
 
* An Informational SIP describes a SushiChain design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the SushiChain community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational SIPs do not necessarily represent a SushiChain community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational SIPs or follow their advice. Information SIPs are typically concerned with decisions specific to an implementation.
 
* A Process SIP describes a process surrounding SushiChain, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SIPs are like Standards Track SIPs but apply to areas other than the SushiChain protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to SushiChain's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational SIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in SushiChain development. Any meta-SIP is also considered a Process SIP.

## SIP Status Field

### Specification

The typical paths of the status of SIPs are as follows:

![SIP Process][sips-process-img]

Champions of a SIP may decide on their own to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn. The SIP editor may also change the status to Deferred when no progress is being made on the SIP.

A SIP may only change status from Draft (or Rejected) to Proposed, when the author deems it is complete and has a working implementation (where applicable). The implementation may be provided by any party, including the SIP champion. The SushiChain Foundation may also instruct a third party to implement the proposal. The SushiChain Foundation takes such a decision based on technical and scientific arguments (e.g., provided on [SIPS issue tracker][sips-issue-tracker], feasibility and in accordance with the objectives of the SushiChain Foundation.

Anyone, including the SIP champion and the SushiChain Foundation, can propose the network to adopt an implementation of a SIP. If some nodes adopt this implementation, it may result in a fork of the network depending on the nature of the implied changes. In the case of such a fork, the SushiChain Foundation will announce which chain they consider to be the SushiChain blockchain. All other chains will be treated as forks of the SushiChain blockchain. A SIP that results in a fork progresses to Final once the SushiChain Foundation declared the resulting chain to be the SushiChain blockchain. The SushiChain Foundation is making this decision based on several factors, including the acceptance of nodes, delegates and exchanges.

A SIP of type Process does not imply any implementation that needs to be adopted by the nodes. Therefore, the requirement for changing the status to Final is different: A SIP of type Process may change status from Draft to Final when has been open to discussion on [SIPS issue tracker][sips-issue-tracker] for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it.

SIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status, to Rejected status, upon request by any person, if they have not made progress in three years. Such a SIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.

When a Final SIP is no longer relevant, its status should be changed to Replaced. This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.


## SIP Comments

### Specification

Each SIP should, in its preamble, link to issue on the [SIPS issue tracker][sips-issue-tracker] with a summary tone of the comments on that issue (see below for possible summary tones). Reviewers of the SIP who consider themselves qualified, should post their own comments on this issue page. 

After some time, the SIP may be updated with a summary tone of the comments. Summary tones may be chosen from the following, but this SIP does not intend to cover all possible nuances and other summaries may be used as needed:

* No comments yet
* Unanimously Recommended for implementation
* Unanimously Discouraged for implementation
* Mostly Recommended for implementation, with some Discouragement
* Mostly Discouraged for implementation, with some Recommendation

For example, the preamble to SIP 0001 might be updated to include the line:

    Comments-Summary: No comments yet.
    Comments-URI: https://github.com/SushiChain/SIPS/issues/1

These fields must follow the "Discussions-To" header (if that header is not present, it should follow the position where it would be present; generally this is immediately above the Status header).

To avoid doubt: comments and status are unrelated metrics to judge a SIP, and neither should be directly influencing the other.

### Rationale

What is the purpose of SIP comments?

* There is a danger that some people will regard SIPs as a "good idea" simply by virtue of them being assigned a SIP number. Due to the low barrier of entry for submission of new SIPs, it seems advisable for a way for reviewers to express their opinions on them in a way that is consumable to the public without needing to review the entire development discussion.

* Participants should freely refrain from commenting outside of their area of knowledge or expertise. However, comments should not be censored, and participation should be open to the public.
